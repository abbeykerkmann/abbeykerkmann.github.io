        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>I have picked up a range of hobbies over the years, here are a few of my most notable ones:</p>

        <h2>Ice Hockey</h2>
        <p>I have been a hockey play for about 15 years of my life, 
            and I intend to continue playing for as long as I can.</p>
        <p>I have mostly participated in women's leagues but have recently also tried playing with men.</p>
        <p>I also did play competitive hockey for a bit, but eventually decided to prioritize my education.</p>
        <p>Here are some pictures of me in action!</p>

        <h2>Video Gaming</h2>
        <p>I grew up playing video games with my little brother on Xbox 360.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to now, I've built my very own gaming PC and I continue to enjoy some of the same games I grew up with.</p>
        <!--Insert image of my PC here!-->
        <p>I mostly enjoy story rich games with role playing aspects as well as survival games. I also have a soft spot for cozy games I can play through for a bit of relaxation.</p>
        <p>Some of the games I have been enjoying lately are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Destiny 2</li>
            <li>Baldurs Gate 3</li>
            <li>Ark Survival Evolved</li>
            <li>League of Legends</li>
            <li>Cyberpunk 2077</li>
        </ul>
