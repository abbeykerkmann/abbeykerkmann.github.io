            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <div style="display: flex;">
                <div style="flex: 50%;">
                    <p>My name is Abbey! I am 24 years old, and I am a Software Engineer working full time in the Software Development industry.
                        I started working full time in January 2022 at Kandy Communications. I have been working fully remotely for almost 2 years now.</p>
                    <p>I graduated with a Bachelor's of Applied Science in Software Engineering from the University of Ottawa in December 2021.
                        I made the Dean's List, and I was awarded with the Cum Laude distinction.
                        Part of the reason why I chose to go to uOttawa was that they offered courses in French. I was part of a French program since elementary school, so I decided to go for full bilingual status and practised by completing half of my university credits in French. I was awarded with a certificate of fluency in the French language as part of my Bachelor's degree.
                        I was also a member of the COOP program, and completed 5 4-month work terms.</p>
                    <p>Besides my work experience and education; I am an athlete, outdoorswoman, and avid video gamer.
                        I love to read fantasy novels and emerse myself in fantasy universes when I play Dungeons and Dragons with my friends.</p>
